            <h1>About Our Team</h1>
            <p> In the autumn of 2022, our team collaborated to develop 
                the Husky Scheduler, a platform designed to streamline 
                course planning for the current students at the University of Washington.
                This website offers a range of features, including course 
                recommendations, course information, prerequisites, 
                and other essential details. Our endeavor aims to provide 
                a user-friendly resource that enhances the course planning 
                experience for the university's student community.

                <h2>Rushi Katabathuni</h2>
                <p>I chose to join the Husky Coding Project because I 
                    wanted to improve my programming skills and participate in developing
                    interesting and creative projects. I involved myself in this project
                    because it could be an effective, yet simple, course planning tool.

                <p> My initial involvement with 
                    HCP was driven by a desire to refine my programming skills. The 
                    opportunity to harness creative freedom and construct projects 
                    aligned with my passions was particularly appealing to me. Equally 
                    significant was the prospect of forging new connections and friendships.

                <p>I joined HCP to experience what it truely means to code with others. Throughout making this website, I have learned great teamwork skills, 
                    problem solving skills, and HOW TO CODE WITH OTHERS! Hope you enjoy our project!!</p>
